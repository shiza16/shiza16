# Hi! I'm Shiza Azam ðŸ‘‹

## Data Engineer

### About Me

I work as a Data Engineer, focusing on developing and managing data engineering projects with a variety of tools and frameworks. I tackle each project with a proactive mindset, consistently learning and implementing best practices to improve efficiency. My commitment to sustainability drives me to complete tasks in the most eco-friendly manner possible.

I understand the importance of theoretical knowledge in data engineering. As such, I stay informed about distributed computing principles, big data applications, streaming data management, pipeline scheduling and orchestration, cloud environments, and more.

Alongside these concepts, I am dedicated to refining my coding skills, particularly in Python and SQL. I write complex Python scripts and SQL queries to solve various challenges. Feel free to explore my data engineering projects on this GitHub repository. Welcome!
